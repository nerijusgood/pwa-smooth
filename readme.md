# HN

Well its a simple app that loads HN from api.

### Tech

  - PreactJS (tiny version of ReactJS)
  - Webpack
  - Sass
  - ES6

Basically I used a starter pack that I have been using to create other projects. All the interesting code is sitauted in [a home.jsx](src/views/pages/home.jsx). All the relavant code is JS ES6, while tempalate compiling is done with Preact.

Not much to tell. Pretty straight forward. Also, I merged (assigned) arrays of items and users on purposes - faster and none of the data is overwritted :)


PS - surge domain was auto generated, I swear!


### Run

`yarn`
`yarn watch`
`yarn build`
